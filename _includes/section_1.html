    <p>
        SusHack is a <strong>free</strong> one-day hack day that's taking place on <strong>Saturday 4th July 2015, from 9:30am until 6pm (or whenever we finish)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        SusHack helps developers get together to create solutions to sustainability problems using their skills in development and lots of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
        The aim of the hack day isn't to deliver any polished software, but to rapidly take something from an idea through to a working/demonstrable piece of software.
    </p>
    <p>
        SusHack is completely free to attend. We've got the space, food/refreshments and WiFi, all you need to bring is yourself and your laptop.
